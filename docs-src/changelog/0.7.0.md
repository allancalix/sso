# 0.7.0 (2019-10-19)

## Added

- Added `Debug` trait implementations for public types.
- Added filters to key list endpoint with `KeyFilter` options.
- Added filters to service list endpoint with `ServiceFilter` options.
- Added `id` query parameter array for key, service and user list endpoint filtering.
- Added `docker-pg-dump`, `docker-pg-restore` targets to `Makefile.toml`.
- Added CSRF create and verify API endpoints.
- Added `PATCH` audit log endpoint for appending data to audit logs. Subject may be left null when audit log created and added later (existing data may not be overwritten).
- Added optional `subject` column to audit log table, added support for filtering.
- Use TimescaleDB hypertable for audit log table.

## Changed

- Changed table column names to remove prefixes for `DriverPostgres`.
- Key value is only returned via created endpoint.
- Include user data in token and key responses so user read is unnecessary.
- Return audit log on endpoints which accept optional audit properties.
- Audit logging improvements, more endpoints now create audit logs for success/failure, diff data is generated for key, service and user updates.
- Added prefix `Sso` to internal audit log types.
- Refactoring, move `api` module to crate root.

## Fixed

- Fixed `clippy` too many arguments warnings.
- Fixed `ClientActor` GET request ignores query string.
- Fixed 500 status code returned trying to create key with invalid service or user ID.
