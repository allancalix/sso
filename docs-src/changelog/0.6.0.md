# 0.6.0 (2019-10-07)

## Changed

- Replaced key flags with type: `Key`, `Token` or `Totp`.
- Added user flags: `password_allow_reset` and `password_require_update`.
- Return `Unauthorised` instead of `Forbidden` for missing authentication.
- User update email and password endpoints accept `user_id` instead of `key` or `token`.

## Fixed

- Fixed read user by ID route `/v1/user/{id}` attempts to read key.
